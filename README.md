## OverTheWire Bandit Walkthrough

Bandit 0 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)

```Level Goal
The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.
```

Navigate to your bandit working directory:

`cd ~/Documents/overthewire/bandit`

We are going to store the SSH credentials for each level in seperate files within the directory that we just navigated to and use sshpass to manage our credentials.  The title of the file is the username and the password is entered on the first line of the file.

Install sshpass with the following on debian-based distros:

`sudo apt install sshpass`

Enter the following command:

`nano bandit0`

Enter the provided password:

`bandit0`

Begin to exit nano by hitting `Ctrl + x` 

Nano will ask "Save modified buffer?"

`y`

Nano will ask "File Name to Write: bandit0", hit `enter`

---

Bandit 0 --> 1 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)

```Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.
```

Connect to the Bandit 0 level with sshpass:

```
sshpass -p `cat bandit0` ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

`ls -la`

`cat readme`

Highlight and copy the returned password

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

---

Bandit 16 --> 17 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit17.html)

```Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

---

Bandit 19 --> 20 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit20.html)

```Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.
```

---

Bandit 20 --> 21 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit21.html)

```Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

Bandit 23 --> 24 (https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit24.html)

```Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…
